# Abstract:
The market for premium skincare products is strong. However, a significant section of the clients cannot afford expensive skincare products. The aim of this study was to identify cost-effective alternatives for high-end skincare items. I applied NLP's BERT model for this (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). This is a well-known method that Google developed to extract traits from text data.

The data was extracted from the "Look Fantastic" e-commerce website.13 attributes in total were obtained from the website. The final dataset was created after deleting, adding additional columns, and eliminating and imputing null values. The final dataset has nine attributes. Data from three columns—"name," "product details," and "ingredients"—were combined for modeling purposes, and the BERT model was used to analyze the results. The first stage involved utilizing BERT's pre-trained sentence transformer "bert-base-nli-mean-tokens" to obtain the sentence embeddings. Finding the cosine similarity of the text was the second stage. The last stage was to choose the most expensive item from the top three skincare categories—cream, cleanser, and serum and find out the most reasonably priced product which is similar to the expensive product.

The following summarizes the outcome:

Overall, the outcome was quite favorable. An economical products match with almost 90% similarity were discovered.
